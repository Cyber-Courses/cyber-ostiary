All notable changes are documented here. The format follows

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-07

### Fixed

- First deploy to an empty database: the build now registers the OAuth protected
  resources right after the migrations (`db:seed`). Before, parallel build workers
  and concurrent cold starts raced to insert them, and the losing insert failed with
  a duplicate-key error instead of being ignored.
- README screenshots no longer show the Next.js development badge.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- First public release: OAuth 2.1 / OpenID Connect provider and admin console,
  built on Better Auth 1.7.
